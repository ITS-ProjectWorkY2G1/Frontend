# Frontend

**INTRODUCTION**

We will create two websites, one for the users and one for the company. The users' website will have an authentication/registration page, which will guide the users to their personal space. This personal space permits them to manage their accounts but mainly to track activity data such as:
 - number of pool laps
 - heart rate
 - position (latitude and longitude)

This data will be shown with the help of tables and graphs.     

The company website will be made in the same way except for the homepage where the admins can see all the data retrieved by the watches (users' id will not be shown due to privacy policy) and their production batch.

**TOOLS**

For our websites we planned to use:
 - Blazor .NET
 - MudBlazor

The idea behind this decision is because everyone of us has used Blazor during our internship and also because we learned it here at the course.
MudBlazor is a Blazor UI Framework that seems to be a very helpful tool since it grants a lot of components.
